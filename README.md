## Description
This is an application that can be used to write and save notes. When you first open the application, you will be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.  When you click on the link to the notes page, you will be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column. A Save icon will appear in the navigation at the top of the page. When you click that Save icon, then the new note you have entered will be saved and will appear in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

## Installation
You will need to have npm and express installed.

## Usage
